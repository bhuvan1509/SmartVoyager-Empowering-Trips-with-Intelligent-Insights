# SmartVoyager-Empowering-Trips-with-Intelligent-Insights
## Project Moto: Analyze the trip data to plan the upcomming trips efficiently.
The SmartVoyager dashboard provides comprehensive trip insights for travelers, helping them analyze past trips, predict costs, and optimize planning. By leveraging key metrics and visualization techniques, this project enhances decision-making for efficient travel.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of multiple CSV files containing trip-related data, including passenger ratings, city details, trip summaries, and monthly targets. These files provide insights into travel patterns, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

Data Sources & Structure
The dataset includes the following key files:

city_target_passenger_rating.csv – Contains passenger ratings for different cities.

dim_city.csv – Provides city-level details such as location and demographics.

dim_date.csv – Stores date-related attributes for time-based analysis.

dim_repeat_trip_distribution.csv – Tracks repeat trips across different locations.

fact_passenger_summary.csv – Summarizes passenger activity, including trip frequency and preferences.

fact_trips.csv – Contains detailed trip records, including fare, distance, and duration.

monthly_target_new_passengers.csv – Defines monthly targets for acquiring new passengers.

monthly_target_trips.csv – Sets monthly goals for total trips taken.

#### What I did In this project: 
Creating the SmartVoyager trip analysis dashboard involved four main steps:

1. Data Collection & Cleaning
Gathered trip-related datasets (cities, passengers, trips, targets).

Removed duplicates and missing values to ensure clean data.

2. Data Modeling
Connected different tables (fact and dimension tables) to create relationships.

Established key joins for filtering data efficiently.

3. Dashboard Design in Power BI
Added KPIs for tracking revenue, distance, and trip duration.

Used charts and filters to visualize city-based trends and repeat customers.

Created DAX measures for running totals and ranking.
## Conclusion
The dashboard helps in trip planning, cost analysis, and customer trends.

Users can analyze which cities have the highest trips, revenue, and customer loyalty.

It provides data-driven decisions for smarter travel management.
